Description of the project:

Given what has been taught during the five sessions of the course "Advaned Scientific Programming with Python", 
some of my existing Python scripts will be modified in a more organised and well-structured way. 

Basically, the postporcessing of the CFD simulations provides a lot of files with several data. These data need further postprossesing in order to 
extract usefull information about the simulations. Therefore, there is the need to read thousands of data, save them, make some functions, 
plots, contours and comparisons.
